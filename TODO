-= Handle loading multiple modules:

- DT_SHIVA_NEEDED entries can be used for module dependencies
- Running Shiva directly doesn't require needed depenencies but should offer a -m option
  to specify paths.

-= Handle ET_EXEC targets

- Modify userland exec code to handle ET_EXEC targets.
- Create a macro SHIVA_TARGET_ADDRESS(uint64_t addr) that should be used anytime
  we reference an address from the target binary. If the target is PIE then
  SHIVA_TARGET_ADDRESS will compute the address with the base address, i.e.
  addr + ctx->ulexec.base_vaddr -- otherwise if the target is ET_EXEC the
  macro knows to use addr as an absolute addres.
- All modules must also use the SHIVA_TARGET_ADDRESS macro when accessing
a target address.

-= Get SHIVA_TRACE_BP_CALL breakpoints working with a large code model.

- Immediate call only has 2GB offset range positive or negative. We must mmap()
an executable stub segment (Similar to a PLT stub) that our hooked call offset
can reach within 2GB. The stub will simply do:
	movq $64bit_address, %rax
	jmp *%rax

-= Finish INT3 breakpoints all the way

   Currently INT3 breakpoints trigger the callback signal handler, and the
handler is able to restore the previous byte, and rewind back to the opcode
that the breakpoint was set on. The failure is that we don't re-set the
breakpoint after we executed the instruction, this is tricky without PTRACE,
although I have an idea of how we might use the TF (TRACE flag) to cause us to
trigger a secondary handler (After our breakpoint handler) and the secondary
handler will re-set the breakpoint that we just removed to execute its original.

- Same must be done for SIGILL, and SIGSEGV breakpoint types.


-= Shiva segfaults when run in interpreter mode sometimes.

Pretty sure this is a bug related to where I copy the top of the old stack to the top of the
new stack, in shiva.c --

	o_stack = (uint8_t *)rsp;
	o_stack_addr = (uint64_t)o_stack;
	/*
	 * XXX BUG XXX
	 * There is a bug here that occasionally results in a segfault
	 * later on in the code.
	 * There are some situations I think where the o_stack_end
	 * (Which points to the highest stack address) needs to be
	 * page aligned up one more time. There's not enough room
	 * being allocated for the stacks copylen in some cases with the
	 * current code... debug this!
	 */
	o_stack_end = ELF_PAGEALIGN(o_stack_addr, 0x1000);
	copy_len = o_stack_end - o_stack_addr;

	shiva_debug("o_stack_addr: %#lx o_stack_end: %#lx\n", o_stack_addr, o_stack_end);
	/*
	 * shiva_ulexec_allocstack() returns a pointer that points to the very
	 * end of the stack (Top of the stack really).
	 */
	shiva_debug("copy_len: %d\n", copy_len);
	shiva_debug("Copying to %p from %p\n", n_stack - copy_len, o_stack);
	n_stack = n_stack - copy_len;
	memcpy(n_stack, o_stack, copy_len);


-= shiva_trace_get_regs() / shiva_trace_set_regs() not complete


-= Get fcf-protection PLT stub (i.e. .plt.sec etc.) support working

- libelfmaster is what handles the PLT resolutions under the hood
and needs to be fixed to properly handle -fcf-protection. The plt is
differently. Usually there is just a .plt and a .got.plt, now there
is: .plt, .plt.sec, .plt.got, and .got.plt
